### Field Mapping Example

In this example workflow, a Cycle is triggered when a Contact Form 7 form is submitted. Before the contact form data is sent to Salesforce it is sent to FullContact to discover more information on the user.

You can then pass data values from the FullContact connector to your CRM, which is shown below being mapped in the Salesforce connector.
