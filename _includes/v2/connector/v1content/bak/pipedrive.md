## Automating Pipedrive

### Automating Deals

Our Pipedrive connector includes a number of webhooks. These are real-time event notifications that fire when something happens to a deal, e.g. when one is created or updated.

Example uses:

- Sync new deals with another system
- Trigger time-based actions for deals stuck at a certain stage
- At key deal stages, add the associated contacts to a marketing system
- Automate internal Pipedrive deals, e.g. when a deal hits a certain stage move it to a different pipeline

#### Deal stage lookups

One of the keys to using Pipedrive's deals is working with the Stage ID in a Cyclr Decision step. In doing this, you can trigger the next appropriate action, either in Pipedrive or in another app.
