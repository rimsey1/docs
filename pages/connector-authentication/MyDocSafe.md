### Partner Setup

Before setting up the **MyDocSafe** Connector, you will need to get an **application key** and an **application secret**.

These are obtained by creating a MyDocSafe application; Please contact [MyDocSafe](https://mydocsafe.com/uk/support/technical-support/) if you don't have your application yet.

### Cyclr Setup

Setup your MyDocSafe App within Cyclr:

*   Go to your **Cyclr Console**
*   Click the **Connectors** menu along the top
*   Choose Connector Library
*   Scroll down to **MyDocSafe**
*   Click the **Setup** button

Enter the following values:

* **Client ID**
* **Client Secret**

(These are the **application key** and **application secret** you should have received from MyDocSafe).

 Sign in to MyDocSafe and allow Cyclr Connector to connect to it.

Your MyDocSafe Connector is now setup! You can test it by installing it in one of your Cyclr accounts and executing one of the methods to confirm it can return some data.
