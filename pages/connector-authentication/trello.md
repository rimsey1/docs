## Partner Setup

2. Under **Allowed Origins** > **Current Origins** enter your callback URL:
<br><br>https://``Your-Service-Domain``/connector/callback<br><br>Your service domain can be found in your Cyclr console under Settings > General Settings > Service Domain.

3. Note the OAuth1 Secret:<br>![OAuth1 Secret](./images/oauth1secrettrello.png)
