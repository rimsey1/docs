# Google Ads set up

You need to do the following to enable Google Ads access for the Google Ads connector:

1. Enable the Google Ads API for a project within your workspace.
2. Obtain your **client ID** and **client secret** by setting up OAuth 2.0 credentials.
3. Obtain your **developer token** for your Google Ads account.
4. Obtain the end user's **client customer ID** for the Google Ads client account they want to manage via the API.

### Enabling the Google Ads API

To access the Google Ads API endpoints, you need to enable the Google Ads API within a project in your workspace. Google’s documentation on how to do this can be found [here](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158841?hl=en).

### Obtaining your client ID and client secret

You need a **client ID** and **client secret** to set up the Google Ads connector in Cyclr. You can obtain these by creating OAuth 2.0 credentials for the Google project where you enabled the Google Ads API in the previous step. Google's documentation on how to do this can be found [here](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en). You need to set up the fields below as follows:

-   **Authorised redirect URIs**: Your Cyclr callback URL e.g. https://{{Your Cyclr service domain e.g. app-h.cyclr.com}}/connector/callback

Once you have created OAuth 2.0 credentials, make note of the **client ID** and **client secret** as you need both needed to set up the Google Ads connector in Cyclr.

### Obtaining your developer token
